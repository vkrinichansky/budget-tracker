# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

This document explains Domain-Driven Design principles and how they are implemented in the SmartExpense application.

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating software that reflects the real-world business domain. It emphasizes understanding the business logic and organizing code around business concepts rather than technical concerns.

## Core DDD Concepts

### Domain

The domain is the business area that the software addresses. It contains the core business logic and rules that are essential to the application's purpose.

### Bounded Context

A bounded context defines the boundaries within which a particular domain model is valid. It's a way to organize large applications by separating different business areas.

### Entities

Entities are objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle. They are defined by their identity rather than their attributes.

### Value Objects

Value objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes rather than their identity. They represent concepts like money, addresses, or dates.

### Aggregates

Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit for data consistency.

### Domain Services

Domain services contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit within entities or value objects.

## DDD Implementation in SmartExpense

### Domain Module Pattern

Each domain follows a consistent structure:

```
domain-name/
├── components/          # Domain-specific UI components
├── services/           # Business logic services
│   ├── domain-service/     # Core business logic
│   ├── domain-api-service/ # Data access layer
│   └── domain-facade/      # Public API facade
├── models/             # Domain entities and interfaces
├── store/              # State management (NgRx)
│   ├── domain.actions.ts    # Action definitions
│   ├── domain.effects.ts    # Side effects handling
│   ├── domain.reducer.ts    # State reducer
│   ├── domain.selectors.ts  # State selectors
│   ├── feature-selector.ts  # Feature selector
│   └── index.ts             # Store exports
└── domain.module.ts    # Domain module definition
```

### Service Architecture

Each domain implements a three-layer service architecture:

#### Domain Service
**Purpose**: Core business logic and state management
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - State selectors and actions
  - Business rule enforcement
  - Event bus communication
  - Complex business workflows
- **Dependencies**: Store, EventBus, other domain services
- **Structure**: Contains comments for strict organization (SELECTORS, ACTIONS, FLOW TRIGGERS)

#### API Service
**Purpose**: Data access and external service integration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Firestore database operations
  - External API calls
  - Data transformation
  - Error handling for data operations
- **Dependencies**: Firebase services, HTTP clients

#### Facade Service
**Purpose**: Public API and service orchestration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Unified public interface
  - Service composition
  - Cross-service coordination
  - API abstraction for components
- **Dependencies**: Domain Service, API Service
- **Structure**: Contains comments for strict organization (SELECTORS, ACTIONS, FLOW TRIGGERS, UTILS)

## DDD Benefits in SmartExpense

### Clear Separation of Concerns

Each domain handles its own business logic, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

### Scalability

New features can be added as new domains without affecting existing functionality.

### Testability

Domain logic is isolated and can be tested independently of UI components.

### Team Collaboration

Different teams can work on different domains without conflicts.

## Best Practices

### Domain Boundaries

- Keep domain logic within domain boundaries
- Avoid cross-domain dependencies
- Use orchestrators for complex workflows

### State Management

- Each domain manages its own state
- Use NgRx for predictable state updates
- Implement proper error handling

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test domain services
- Integration test domain interactions
- Mock external dependencies

## Implementation Guidelines

### Adding New Domains

1. Create domain module structure
2. Define domain entities and services
3. Implement state management
4. Create UI components
5. Add domain to main application

### Domain Evolution

- Refactor domain boundaries as business needs change
- Extract new domains from existing ones
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Documentation

- Document domain responsibilities
- Explain business rules and constraints
- Provide usage examples
